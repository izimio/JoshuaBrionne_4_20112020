OC web dev formation's 4th project

In this project we were missioned to optimize as much as possible a donated website's SEO and laoding time.
while doing this we were supposed to recreate the accesibility of the website in order to make it as much accessible as possible to the most user around the web.

Darkening a button while hovering it, include placeholders inside the form and so on.

This project took me around 1 week and was a super great opportunity to learn a wall new world, AKA the UX.
